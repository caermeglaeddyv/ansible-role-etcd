# defaults file for etcd


# Name of separate device in /dev/disk/by-path/ for etcd storage:
etcd_disk_path: ""          # pci-0000:13:00.0-scsi-0:0:0:0

# Defines the way to deploy etcd, currently the only supported option is
# with kubeadm, which creates certificates and runs cluster inside containers:
etcd_deployment_type: with_kubeadm

# Variable which is common for most projects, used in
# configuration files or file/directory names.
# By default used as reference for etcd_project_dir variable.
# Currently used as prefix for etcd initial cluster token:
etcd_project_name: test

# Variable which is common for most projects, used as
# project working directory on the localhost for the role.
# Currently is used for fetching etcd certificates
# to localhost and copying them among other cluster members:
etcd_project_dir: files/{{ etcd_project_name }}

# SANs which will be added to etcd server certificate:
etcd_server_cert_sans: []
# - abc.xyz
# - 1.2.3.4

# Initial cluster state for etcd cluster:
etcd_initial_cluster_state: new

# Initial cluster token to make sure etcd will contact
# members of it's cluster only in the network:
etcd_initial_cluster_token: "{{ etcd_project_name }}-etcd"

# Minimum version of TLS used:
etcd_tls_min_version: VersionTLS12

# Cipher suites used with TLS:
etcd_tls_cipher_suites:
